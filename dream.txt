# A Dream within a Dream
## Edgar Allan Poe

Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now
Thus much let me avow
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream
And hope does not fly away
In a night or in a daty
in a vision or in none
Is it therefore to be gone?
All that we see or seem
is but a dream within a dream
I stand with the roar of a bla bla bla
And I hold within my hand
grains of the golden sand

I stand amid the roar
of a surg tormeted shore
and I shole within my hand
grains of the golden sand
How gew yet how they creep
and bla bla bla
while I weep, while i weep
o god, can I not save
one from the pitiless wave
but a dream within a dream
